## Hi there. I'm Neel 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at McMaster University 🦅  
I enjoy building software that makes a difference — whether it's helping people, solving real-world problems, or just exploring new tech.

Most of the time, you'll catch me working on things like 💻  
- a tool to support patients and healthcare workflows  
- cybersecurity systems that prioritize safety and reliability  
- my [personal portfolio](https://neeloza115.github.io) where I showcase the projects I care about  

When I’m not coding, I’m probably out 🏞️  
- hiking and enjoying nature  
- learning new skills to grow as a developer and person  
- or... still coding anyway 😄

Thanks for visiting my GitHub!
